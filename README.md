# Brain-tumor-classification-task_CNN-model

Accurate diagnostics of brain tumors improve the life expectaction of patients. However, current diagnosis techniques are error-prone due to their complexities. Thus, building ML models that accurately diagnose the type of brain tumor from an MRI scan is of great interest. Since MRI scans only depict low-level spatial features, using transfer learning from performant CNN models points to a more viable solution.

Therefore, in the context of the MAIS 202 bootcamp, I built a webapp landing page that illustrates the performance of my ML model which accurately predicts the presence and type of brain tumor(pituitary, meningioma, glioma or no tumor) of an individual's MRI scan image from any anatomical plane.
